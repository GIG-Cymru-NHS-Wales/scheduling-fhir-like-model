## 1. Overview
Within the National Immunisation Framework, a `Communication` is a record of clinical/business level information being transmitted or shared. Within the initial workflows, this relates to correspondence relating to an `Appointment`. (E.g, letter communicating a record of booking/cancellation) The use of the resource is to track meaningful information relating to the configuration parameters used to send the corespondence, and is strongly based on the `Communication` resource outlined in FHIR.

To ensure consistent and accurate recording of records of `Communication`s across different healthcare systems, it is essential that we standardise the data set used for recording. Our aim is to leverage the FHIR data models (specifically the `Communication`) put together via the Information Standards team, and create a model that could easily be transformed into the shape that they've set out. By doing this, we can ensure that consuming applications are storing data in a reliable, reasonable and interpretable way, which will be universally recognised. This approach will enhance data quality, facilitate easy interoperability with other systems, and provide a basis for universally understandable reporting and analytics.


## 1.1 Why is Communication not a root aggregate/it's own service?
While `Communication`s may eventually be moved into their own service as part of a long-term architectural evolution, in the current design, it makes sense for a `Communication` to exist as part of a single `Appointment` resource as an aggregate. This is because Communications derive their meaning entirely from the context of an `Appointment`. For instance, if an `Appointment` were to be deleted, its associated `Communication`s would no longer hold relevance and would also be removed. Furthermore, a `Communication` record is inherently tied to a specific `Appointment`â€”without this association, the `Communication` itself would lack purpose or context

## 2. Reference Data
### 2.1. Source
The following resources helped inform the design of this resource, alongside any valuesets used for populating the data:
- Based on the [Communication - HL7](https://build.fhir.org/communication.html) model.
- The `AppointmentStatusId` should correlate to an associated `EventStatus` value set defined via [EventStatus - HL7](https://build.fhir.org/valueset-event-status.html).
- The `StatusReasonId` should correlate to an associated `CommunicationNotDoneReason` value set defined via [CommunicationNotDoneReason - HL7](https://build.fhir.org/valueset-communication-not-done-reason.html)
- The `CommunicationCategoryId` should correlate to an associated `CommunicationCategory` value set definied via [CommunicationCategory - HL7](https://build.fhir.org/valueset-communication-category.html).
- The `PriorityId` should correlate to an associated `RequestPriority` value set deined via [RequestPriority - HL7](https://build.fhir.org/valueset-request-priority.html).
- The `MediumId` should correlate to an assocaited `ParticipationMode` value set defined via [Participation Mode - HL7](http://terminology.hl7.org/6.1.0/ValueSet-v3-ParticipationMode.html).
- The `TopicId` should correlate to an associated `CommunicationTopic` value set defined via [CommunicationTopic - HL7](https://build.fhir.org/valueset-communication-topic.html).
- 

### 2.2. Adaptations
The following changes were made to facilitate the design into our own local implementation:
- The `instantiatesCanonical` (& associated `instantiatesUrl`) resource has been ommitted, as the underlying referenced resource doesn't seem to map to our workflows. (Not marked as mandatory in FHIR)
- The `basedOn` resource has been ommitted, as the underlying referenced resources doesn't seem to be map to our workflows. (Not marked as mandatory in FHIR.)
- The `partOf` & `about` fields aren't present in the model, however, both can be reflected via the associated `AppointmentId` pending further investigation in the most appropriate resource.
- `inResponseTo` has been ommitted, as Communications are currently singular, and don't follow a bi-directional functionality.
- `status` has been changed to the `StatusId` field.
- `statusReason` has been changed to a singular `StatusReasonId` field, associated with a `StatusReason` reference data resource, that can further expand into the `CodeableConcept` shape.
- `category` has been changed to a singular `CommunicationCategoryId` field, associated with a `CommunicationCategory` reference data resource, that can further expand into the `CodeableConcept` shape.
- `priority` has been changed to the `StatusId` field.
- `medium` has been changed to a singular `MediumId`  field, associated with a `ParticipationMode` reference data resource, that can further expand into the `CodeableConcept` shape.
- `subject` & `recipient` has been changed to the singular `PatientNhsNumber` field, that can be further expanded via the `Demographics` microservice dataset. (See `Patient` resource.)
- `topic` has been changed to a singular `TopicId`  field, associated with a `CommunicationTopic` reference data resource, that can further expand into the `CodeableConcept` shape.
- `encounter` field has been ommitted, as this can be inflected via the underlying `Appointment` resource.
- `receieved` field has been ommited, as the use of the Notify service doesn't easily allow us to update this field. (NIF works more in a 'fire and forget' way.)
- `sender` has been ommitted, but eventually will reference an `Organisation` resource when the Location service is fully modelled.
- `reason` has been ommitted, as the underlying `SnomedCTClinicalFindings` data set doesn't neatly align with the work flows.
- `payload` has been ommitted, as this data set is resourced within the Notify service.
- An additional `AppointmentId` field has been added, as a way to link to an underlying appointment.
- An additional `EmsgId` field has been added, as a temporary measure until correspondence has been fully rewritten.

## 6. Legacy Mapping
This section describes how the fields in the new resource map to the legacy `EMSG_QUEUE` table. The goal is to ensure clarity in how existing data can be transitioned or integrated with the new structure.

### 6.1. Mapping Table - IMM_CHILD_COURSES_GIVEN_WIS
| **New Field**               | **Legacy Field**            | **Transformation/Notes**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Identifier`                | Not applicable      | Data has been normalised, so now a separate resource and requires a new Guuid identifier.                                            |
| `ImmunisationId`            | `PK_FK_IMM_GIVEN_ID`           | Maps directly. Need to ensure we're using the new Guuid values for Immunisation results.                       |
| `Date`                      | Not applicable.                                            | Not Applicable. |
| `AdverseReactionTypeId`     | `ADVERSE_REACTION_TYPE_ID`  | Maps directly. Ensure that the ID references the correct `AdverseReactionType` table, and is usng the new SNOMED CT IDs.                          |
| `Note`                      | Not applicable.                                            | Not Applicable. |
| `Reported`                  | Not Applicable               | Always set this to 'Y'                         |
| `MedicalAttentionRequired`  | Not Applicable   | Set this to null       |
| `Recorded`                  | Not applicable.                                            | Not Applicable. |
| `ConcurrencyToken`          | `CONCURRENCY_TOKEN`         | Maps directly. Default to a timestamp as defined.                                                              |
